    title = {{Method of Adjacent Distance Array Outperforms Conventional Huffman Codes to Decode Bengali Transliterated Text Swiftly}},
    author = {Sarker, Pranta and Rahman, Mir Lutfur},
    abstract={This research works on high symbolic Bengali text and transforms it into corresponding less symbolic English complying with the transliteration method. The Huffman-based approaches serve to compress retaining the original quality of the data. On the other hand, faster encoding and decoding is the most sophisticated sphere in data compression. We propose an adjacent distance array, a novel data structure based on the Huffman principle for encoding and decoding the character of transliterated text. The encoding and decoding algorithms have been explained for the introduced modus operandi and juxtaposed with conventional Huffman-based algorithms. Our research is outdoing than any regular Huffman-based algorithms, concentrating on the speed of the encoding and decoding manner discovered after estimating all decisions.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
