    abstract={The evaluation of Huffman-based algorithm can be measured in two ways: one in terms of space and another is decoding speed. As memory requirement is going to be reasonable, the time effectiveness of Huffman decoding is more significant. So, this research concentrated on making the decoding speed faster for Huffman codes as well as maintaining the compression ratio for text data. For this, a new technique based on an adjacent distance array is introduced here. Adjacent distance array can save the distances for each adjacent symbol by calculating their ASCII values. Also, we have used a threshold value so that we can skip large codeword for all the adjacent symbols that would be produced by traversing whole Huffman tree. During the decoding process, the adjacent distance array is used to decode adjacent symbols by computing the distances instead of traversing the whole Huffman tree. We have described the encoding and decoding processes for the proposed technique. Besides, we have tested the proposed method on a few renowned corpuses and compared the performance with existing Huffman-based methods. Therefore, we have found that the proposed method performs more effectively in terms of compressionâ€“decompression time.},

    title = {{Introduction to Adjacent Distance Array with Huffman Principle: A New Encoding and Decoding Technique for Transliteration Based Bengali Text Compression}},
    abstract={Constructing a binary tree, the Huffman algorithm introduced the method of text compression that helps to reduce the size keeping the original message of the file. Nowadays, Huffman-based algorithm assessment can be measured in two ways; one in terms of space, another is decoding speed. The requirement of memory for a text file is going to be reasonable while the time effectiveness of Huffman decoding is being more significant. Meanwhile, this research is introducing the adjacent distance array with Huffman principle as a new data structure for encoding, and decoding the Bengali text compression using transliterated English text. Since the transliterated English text accommodates to reduce the unit of symbols accordingly, we transliterated the Bengali text into English and then applied the Huffman principle with adjacent distance array. By calculating the ASCII values, adjacent distance array is used to save the distances for each adjacent symbols. Apart from the regular Huffman algorithm, a codeword has produced by traversing the whole Huffman tree for a character in case, respectively adopting the threshold value and adjacent distance array can skip the lengthy codeword and perform the decoding manner to decode estimating the distances for all adjacent symbols except traversing the whole tree. Our findings have acquired 27.54% and 20.94% compression ratios for some specimen transliterated Bengali texts, as well as accomplished a significant ratio on different corpora.},

    abstract = {This research works on high symbolic Bengali text and transforms it into corresponding less symbolic English complying with the transliteration method. The Huffman-based approaches serve to compress retaining the original quality of the data. On the other hand, faster encoding and decoding is the most sophisticated sphere in data compression. We propose an adjacent distance array, a novel data structure based on the Huffman principle for encoding and decoding the character of transliterated text. The encoding and decoding algorithms have been explained for the introduced modus operandi and juxtaposed with conventional Huffman-based algorithms. Our research is outdoing than any regular Huffman-based algorithms, concentrating on the speed of the encoding and decoding manner discovered after estimating all decisions.},
