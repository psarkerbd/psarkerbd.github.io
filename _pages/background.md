My <b>undergraduate</b> thesis, <a href='https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-3607-6_25'>A Faster Decoding Technique for Huffman Codes Using Adjacent Distance Array</a>, relied on data compression and Huffman coding. The research introduced an <em>adjacent distance array</em> data structure that significantly mitigates the encoding-decoding timing for English corpora.

Apart from this, I utilized Python's Tkinter feature to develop some exciting desktop projects. Furthermore, I am acquainted with PHP, a backend programming language and HTML, and W3CSS for developing many Web projects. All of this <a href='https://psarkerbd.github.io/repositories/'>learning</a> delighted my studying career at the University.
