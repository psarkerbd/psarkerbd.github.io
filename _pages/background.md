My <b>undergraduate</b> thesis, <a href='https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-3607-6_25'>A Faster Decoding Technique for Huffman Codes Using Adjacent Distance Array</a>, relied on data compression and Huffman coding. The research introduced an <em>adjacent distance array</em> data structure that significantly <u>mitigates the encoding-decoding timing for English corpora </u>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The research was further updated with a transliteration-based approach by publishing <a href='https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-4299-6_45'>Introduction to Adjacent Distance Array with Huffman Principle: A New Encoding and Decoding Technique for Transliteration Based Bengali Text Compression </a>. Nevertheless, at that time, the method could <u>compress the Bengali text</u> by <u>introducing the data structure</u>, <u>allowing the transliteration method</u>. The transliteration approach is a mechanism that <u>represents a Bengali character to one or more corresponding English alphabets or ASCII symbols</u>, such as <a href='https://www.omicronlab.com/avro-keyboard.html'>Avro Phonetic Layout</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In addition, proof has been found that the research's compression methodology outperforms traditional any Huffman-based approaches in terms of <u>compression-decompression time for the Bengali transliterated text</u>. The study's outcome is entitled <a href='https://journal.uob.edu.bh/handle/123456789/4498'>Method of Adjacent Distance Array Outperforms Conventional Huffman Codes to Decode Bengali Transliterated Text Swiftly</a> published in a Scopus-indexed <a href='https://journal.uob.edu.bh/handle/123456789/12?id=about'>journal</a>.
