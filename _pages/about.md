I am a Lecturer in the Department of Science and Engineering at North East University Bangladesh. After completing my bachelor's degree (BSc. (Engg.) in CSE), I joined my University on the 26th of May, 2018. At the same time, I am also involved as a Peer-Reviewer in a Scopus-indexed journal, namely, the International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems. However, I am interested in Data compression, Huffman coding, Blockchain, Trust management, and Security.

I could bear a good knowledge of C, C++, Java, and Python programming languages since I was a competitive programmer in my pupil life. In addition, I have participated in eminent programming competitions such as ICPC, NCPC, and IUPCs for several years. Nevertheless, after joining as a faculty member, I helped enthusiasts by conducting several classes and workshops related to competitive programming, which assisted in flourishing my coaching experience. Thus, I found sound involvement in prestigious programming competitions as a coach.

Apart from this, I utilized Python's Tkinter feature to develop a desktop for projects. Furthermore, I am acquainted with PHP, a backend programming language and HTML, and W3CSS for developing many Web projects. All of this learning delighted my studying career at the University.
