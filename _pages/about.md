I am a <a href='https://www.neub.edu.bd/faculty/school-of-natural-sciences/department-of-computer-science-and-engineering/518-pranta-sarker'>Lecturer</a> in the <a href='https://www.neub.edu.bd/academic/school-of-natural-sciences/department-of-computer-science-and-engineering'>Department of Science and Engineering</a> at <a href='https://www.neub.edu.bd/'>North East University Bangladesh</a>. After completing my Bachelor's degree (BSc.(Engineering) in Computer Science), I joined my University in May 2018. At the same time, I have been involved as a <a href='https://edas.info/showSelf.php?c=26939'>TPC Reviewer</a> in a Scopus-indexed journal, namely, the <a href='https://journal.uob.edu.bh/handle/123456789/12?id=about'>International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems</a>. My research interests cover the areas of <b>Data compression</b>, <b>Data Structure</b>, and <b>Algorithms</b>.
However, at present, the research field of interest is <b>Blockchain</b>, which could ensure privacy and security, manage trust, and evaluate the reputation of a system.

I could bear a good knowledge of C, C++, Java, and Python programming languages since I was a <a href='https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/prantacse14'>competitive programmer</a> in my pupil life. In addition, I have participated in eminent programming competitions such as ICPC, NCPC, and IUPCs for several years. However, after joining as a faculty member, I helped enthusiasts by conducting several classes and workshops related to competitive programming, which assisted in flourishing my coaching experience. Thus, I found sound involvement in prestigious programming competitions as a coach.

My job at the university is divided into three parts: <b>academic</b>, <b>research</b>, and <b>administrative</b>. As a faculty member, the primary role involves delivering engaging and informative lectures to students, utilizing innovative teaching methods to enhance comprehension, designing and implementing fair assessments, grading assignments, and providing constructive feedback to aid student development.
