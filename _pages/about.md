I could bear a good knowledge of C, C++, Java, and Python programming languages since I was a <a href='https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/prantacse14'>competitive programmer</a> in my pupil life. In addition, I have participated in eminent programming competitions such as ICPC, NCPC, and IUPCs for several years. However, after joining as a faculty member, I helped enthusiasts by conducting several classes and workshops related to competitive programming, which assisted in flourishing my coaching experience. Thus, I found sound involvement in prestigious programming competitions as a coach `_pages/cv.md`.
