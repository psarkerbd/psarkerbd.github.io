I am a <a href='https://www.neub.edu.bd/faculty/school-of-natural-sciences/department-of-computer-science-and-engineering/518-pranta-sarker'>Lecturer</a> in the <a href='https://www.neub.edu.bd/academic/school-of-natural-sciences/department-of-computer-science-and-engineering'>Department of Science and Engineering</a> at <a href='https://www.neub.edu.bd/'>North East University Bangladesh</a>. After completing my Bachelor's degree (BSc.(Engineering) in Computer Science), I joined my University in May 2018. For now, I have been involved as a <a href='https://edas.info/showSelf.php?c=26939'>TPC Reviewer</a> in a Scopus-indexed journal, namely, the <a href='https://journal.uob.edu.bh/handle/123456789/12?id=about'>International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems</a>.

The research field of my undergraduate thesis was data compression, which relies on compressing the different types of data by facilitating an appropriate data structure and algorithm. Further, the research has been extended, and I have made some publications on it. Nevertheless, currently, my interest in research is in <b>security</b> and <b>privacy</b>, <b>blockchain</b>, <b>trust</b> and <b>reputation</b> management, <b>artificial intelligence</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, <b>software engineering</b>, <b>data structure</b>, and <b>algorithms</b>.

As a faculty member, the primary role involves delivering engaging and informative lectures to students, utilizing innovative teaching methods to enhance comprehension, designing and implementing fair assessments, grading assignments, and providing constructive feedback to aid student development.
In tandem with teaching, my role involves conducting rigorous research in my field, publishing scholarly articles, and contributing to the academic discourse that allows me to publish <a href="https://psarkerbd.github.io/publications/">Scopus-indexed articles</a>, enhancing enthusiasm in the research area. To describe the administrative rules, I have participated in making an Outcome Based Education (OBE) curriculum for several courses in the program instructed by UGC. In addition, I am still gathering experience as a member of the Result Verification Committee and an Assistant Proctor to serve the proctorial rules at the university.

However, I could bear a good knowledge of C, C++, Java, and Python programming languages since I was a <a href='https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/prantacse14'>competitive programmer</a> in my pupil life. In addition, I have participated in eminent programming competitions such as ICPC, NCPC, and IUPCs for several years. However, after joining as a faculty member, I helped enthusiasts by conducting several classes and workshops related to competitive programming, which assisted in flourishing my coaching experience. Thus, I found sound involvement in prestigious programming competitions as a coach. Apart from this, I utilized Python's Tkinter feature to develop some exciting desktop projects. Furthermore, I am acquainted with PHP, a backend programming language and HTML, and W3CSS for developing many Web projects. All of this <a href='https://psarkerbd.github.io/repositories/'>learning</a> delighted my studying career at the university.
