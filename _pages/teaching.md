title: Teaching
description: I have had the opportunity to take several courses in my teaching career, which are listed below. I have mostly taken Compiler Construction, Theory of Computation, and Software Engineering in different semesters. However, I have enjoyed every course and endeavour to teach and learn new knowledge to the students. <b> *  indicates the contemporary course of the program.</b>
