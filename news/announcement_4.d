On the 17th of February 2022, I was invited by the International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems (IJCDS), a Scopus-indexed journal, to serve as a reviewer of an article. 
It was an excellent opportunity for me as I have enthusiasm for research, and will enhance my reviewing capability, which I most enjoy.


***

As a TPC reviewer, my primary responsibilities are --
<ul>
    <li>Assess and evaluate the assigned research articles favorable to my domain areas.</li>
    <li>Inform the journal's Managing Editor regarding the paper's decision and assessment.</li>
    <li>Scrutinize and identify the articles that violate the journal's norms or are irrelevant to the topic.</li>
</ul>
