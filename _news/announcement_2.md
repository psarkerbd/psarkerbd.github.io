I am happy to get a place as a member of the Result Verification Committee (RVC). The placement is prestigious for me as the university selects only one for each department. However, this time, they chose me.

***

The main rule to be a member of RVC is to be -
<ul>
    <li>Fully support the Controller of Examination (CoE) in the university.</li>
    <li>Cross-check and verify the tabular sheet of the results prepared by CoE with the semester-wise result sheets of all departments.</li>
    <li>Observe the student's results and performance.</li>
</ul>
 

***

I express my gratitude to the Vice Chancellor and related authority of the university.
