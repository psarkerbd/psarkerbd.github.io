I have kept my participation in the <b>Professional Development Training on Bangladesh National Qualification Framework (BNQF) and Outcome Based Education (OBE) Curriculum </b> held on February 13-15 and April 11, 2022, organized by Institutional Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), North East University Bangladesh.

The workshop was based on the OBE. On top of that, how the university manages the OBE education system and the dealing method of students and questions about the quality. Thus, the workshop talks about a curriculum that should be different than the conventional one. Motivated by the workshop, the Department of CSE of North East University Bangladesh eventually launched an OBE curriculum compliant with the government's and UGC's instruction.
