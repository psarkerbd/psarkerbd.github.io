It is my immense pleasure that the university selected me as an Assistant Professor. The decision came out on the 5th of September and will persist until further announcement. I want to thank the Vice Chancellor and related authority of the university.
***
The main rule to be an Assistant Proctor is to -
<ul>
    <li>Assist the Proctor of the university in serving the proctorial rules.</li>
    <li>Counseling students who need to fit in with the university's primary rules and regulations.</li>
    <li>Among the students, always maintain the appropriate environment of the university.</li>
    <li>Making necessary decisions that help to converge the proctorial committee.</li>
</ul>
