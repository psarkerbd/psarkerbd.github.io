The Chair of the 5th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Intelligent Engineering informed me about <b>accepting</b> my paper at the conference, which has been held at Universit√© des Mascareignes (UdM), Mauritius. It is my first proceeding that has been accepted outside the country. On top of that, it is the first-ever Scopus-indexed article I will always cherish. I thank my co-author and conference Chairs for considering my paper. The proceeding has been further published in the Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing (AISC) series of Springer.
