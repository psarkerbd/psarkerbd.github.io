I received an email from the Chairs of the 5th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Intelligent Engineering (ICACIE) regarding accepting my paper, the first outside of Bangladesh. I am still so excited about this achievement and would like to thank my co-author and the Chairs of the conference for considering the paper. Universit√© des Mascareignes (UdM), Mauritius, was responsible for the conference in 2020 and held it in hybrid mode due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/> Nevertheless, Springer's Scopus-indexed book series, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing (AISC), finally published the proceeding.
